## Project name
LUNA (latim)

## High-Level Project Summary

What did you develop? How does it "solve" the challenge? Why is it important?

Eclipses are scary because they show us the unknown. But what if you could learn about space in a fun way? That's LUNA, an open source platform for kids and teens. LUNA teaches you with a friendly guide, and lets you choose your character from different cultures. It works on any device, and it's aligned with the UN goals for education and equity. LUNA is scalable, inclusive, and accessible. It supports multiple languages and interaction. Join us and discover how the darkness can be fascinating.
